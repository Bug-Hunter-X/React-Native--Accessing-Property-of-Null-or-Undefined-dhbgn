# React Native: Accessing Property of Null or Undefined

This repository demonstrates a common React Native error: attempting to access a property of a null or undefined object.  This often occurs when dealing with asynchronous data fetching or navigation, where data may not be immediately available.  The solution involves proper error handling and conditional rendering to avoid accessing properties before they are defined.

## Bug Description:
The bug arises when accessing a property (e.g., `user.name`) of an object (`user`) before the object is fully initialized or when the object is null or undefined. This leads to a runtime error.

## Solution:
The solution includes null checks and conditional rendering.  We verify that the object and its properties exist before trying to access them.  This ensures that the app gracefully handles cases where data might not be available yet.
